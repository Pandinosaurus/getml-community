Example 9: Saving and loading models
--------------------------------------

For a full working example, please refer to :ref:`example09_saving_models.R`.

When you have put in a lot of effort into training your models and optimizing your hyperparameters, you probably want to save them for later use. This is very easy. You just have to define a project and then use *Model.save()* and *Model.load()*.

Here is how you save your model:

.. code-block:: r

    set.autosql.project("examples")

    save.autosql.model(model.1)

Here is how you reload it:

.. code-block:: r

    set.autosql.project("examples")

    model.2 = create.autosql.model(
        name="MyModel"
    )

    model.2 = load.autosql.model(model.2)


This also enables you to train your models in one programming language and the calling them from another programming language.
