Installation
===================

Step 1: Install the AutoSQL engine for your operating system. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You do **NOT** need root or admin rights to install the AutoSQL engine.

On **Linux** and **macOS**, use *cd* to get into the folder that contains *setup.sh*. Then, run setup.sh.

::

    cd /path/to/your/folder
    sh setup.sh

You should now get a message that AutoSQL was successfully installed.

On **Windows**, no installation is necessary other than unzipping the ZIP-file.

Step 2: Install the dependencies (you can skip this step, if you are using Anaconda).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AutoSQL depends on numpy, scipy and pandas. For the examples to run smoothly, you also need matplotlib and scikit-learn. If you have all of these installed already (they are all part of Anaconda), go on. Otherwise, open a console and enter the following:

::

    pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib sklearn

If you are on an Unix system, you possibly need root rights for this, so you might want to use *sudo* (on Ubuntu/Linux Mint/Debian/...) or *su* (on Red Hat Enterprise Linux/Fedora/CentOS/...).

Step 3: Install the AutoSQL Python library. 
--------------------------------------------------------

Use the *cd* command to get into the folder Python, which contains *setup.py*, like this:

::

    cd /path/to/your/folder

on Windows:

::

    cd C:\path\to\your\folder


Then, type:

::

    python setup.py install

The installation should take about one second. Again, you might need root rights for this.

Then, type "python" into your terminal and import autosql, like this:

::

    import autosql.models

If that worked well, you are done. We hope you enjoy using AutoSQL.

**Troubleshooting**
------------------------

Problem 1: My OS tells me I don't have the rights to install this.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are on Linux and operating system tells you that you don't have the proper rights to do this, try something like this (Ubuntu/Linux Mint/Debian/...):

::

    sudo pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sklearn

or

::

    sudo python setup.py install

or this (Red Hat Enterprise Linux/Fedora/CentOS/...):

::

    su
    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sklearn

or

::

    su
    python setup.py install


It will ask you for your user password and then you can install the library.

Problem 2: When I type python into the terminal, it can't find Python.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If this happens, you are probably using Anaconda and you haven't set the PATH variable. You can solve this problem in one of two ways:

1. Reinstall Anaconda. When they ask you to change the PATH variable, say yes. They recommend you not to do it, but do it anyway.

2. Find the folder in Anaconda that contains the python application. Then add that folder to your PATH variable. 

How to add a folder to your PATH variable depends on your operating system. For instance, on Windows, it works like this:

::

    setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\path\to\your\folder\;"

If you aren't really sure about this, your better option is probably to reinstall Anaconda and let them change the path for you.

Problem 3: I have installed the AutoSQL Python library, but now Python can't find it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This happens when you have several Python installations on your computer (for instance, an Anaconda version and another version). Again, this problem can be solved by editing the PATH variable.
