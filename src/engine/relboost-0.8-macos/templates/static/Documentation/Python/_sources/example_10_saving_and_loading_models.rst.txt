Example 10: Saving and loading models
--------------------------------------

For a full working example, please refer to :ref:`example10_saving_models.py`.

When you have put in a lot of effort into training your models and optimizing your hyperparameters, you probably want to save them for later use. This is very easy. You just have to define a project and then use *Model.save()* and *Model.load()*.

Here is how you save your model:

::

    engine.set_project("MyProject")

    model1.save()

Here is how you reload it:

::

    engine.set_project("MyProject")

    model2 = models.Model(name=model1.name).load()


If you know that a particular model is already loaded in the AutoSQL engine (a good way to find out is to check the AutoSQL Monitor), but you want to handle it in Python, you do not have to reload it. Calling *.refresh()* will do the trick:

::

    model3 = models.Model(name=model1.name).refresh()

This also enables you to train your models in one programming language and the calling them from another programming language.
