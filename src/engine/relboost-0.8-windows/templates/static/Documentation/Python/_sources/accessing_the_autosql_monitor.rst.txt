Accessing the AutoSQL Monitor
===============================================

The AutoSQL engine is a standalone program that helps you structure your Data Science project and the process of feature engineering.

Once you have launched the AutoSQL Engine as explained in the previous section, open your favorite browser and type in the following:

::

    http://localhost:1709/

By default, the AutoSQL Monitor does not allow any remote connections. If you want to run it on a remote server, this is what you need to do:

In the folder containing *run*, you will also find a file called *config.json*.

*config.json* contains the settings for the AutoSQL Monitor:

::

    "monitor": {
        "allowRemote": false,
        "port": 1709
    }

In order to allow remote access, set *"allowRemote": true*. You can also edit *"port"* to change the port. Note that the default port for HTTP servers is 80. Please make sure that the port is not already occupied by some other application.

After you have made your changes, save the file and relaunch the AutoSQL engine. You should now be able to access the AutoSQL Monitor as follows:

::

    http://ip.address.of.the.remote.server:1709/

If you want to access the AutoSQL Monitor from on a remote server, it might also be a good idea to add password protection and TLS encryption. You can also do that under the view *Security*. 

After you have created a key and certificate, you have to shut down and relaunch the AutoSQL Engine and the AutoSQL Monitor. After that, you have to access it under https instead of http:

::

    https://ip.address.of.the.remote.server:1709/

Your browser will probably ask you to create an exception for the certificate, unless you register it with a certificate authority.

Again, you can also change the port by editing *config.json*. Note that the default port for HTTPS servers is 443.
