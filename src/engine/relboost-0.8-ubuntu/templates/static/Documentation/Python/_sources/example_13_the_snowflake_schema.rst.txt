Example 13: The Snowflake Schema
-------------------------------------

For a full working example, please refer to :ref:`example13_snowflake_schema.py`.

So far, all of our examples have involved a simple star schema. In our experience, the star schema is appropriate for some 80% of all data science projects. But there are cases, in which you need a more complex data schema: In the *snowflake schema*, peripheral table can have peripheral tables of their own. 

In this example, our target variable looks as follows:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT AVG( feature_1_1 )
    FROM POPULATION t1
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT COUNT( * ) AS feature_1_1
        FROM PERIPHERAL t3
        LEFT JOIN PERIPHERAL2 t4
        ON t3.join_key2 = t4.join_key2
        WHERE (
           ( t3.time_stamp - t4.time_stamp <= 0.5 )
        ) AND t4.time_stamp <= t3.time_stamp
        GROUP BY t3.join_key,
             t3.time_stamp
    ) t2
    ON t1.join_key = t2.join_key
    WHERE t2.time_stamp <= t1.time_stamp
    GROUP BY t1.join_key,
         t1.time_stamp;

In this case, we need to take the average of counts, in other words we need two nested aggregations. The peripheral table ("PERIPHERAL") has a peripheral table of its own ("PERIPHERAL2").

Again, we expect AutoSQL to find this sort of logic on its own, with minimal input from the user.

Building the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As usual, we need to communicate the data schema to AutoSQL:

::

    population_placeholder = models.Placeholder(
        name="POPULATION",
        numerical=["column_01"],
        join_keys=["join_key"],
        time_stamps=["time_stamp"],
        targets=["targets"]
    )

    peripheral_placeholder = models.Placeholder(
        name="PERIPHERAL",
        numerical=["column_01"],
        join_keys=["join_key", "join_key2"],
        time_stamps=["time_stamp"]
    )

    peripheral2_placeholder = models.Placeholder(
        name="PERIPHERAL2",
        numerical=["column_01"],
        join_keys=["join_key2"],
        time_stamps=["time_stamp"]
    )

    peripheral_placeholder.join(peripheral2_placeholder, "join_key2", "time_stamp")

    population_placeholder.join(peripheral_placeholder, "join_key", "time_stamp")

    model = models.Model(
        population=population_placeholder,
        peripheral=[peripheral_placeholder, peripheral2_placeholder],
        predictor=predictors.XGBoostRegressor(
        booster="gblinear", reg_alpha=10.0, gamma=1.0),
        loss_function=loss_functions.SquareLoss(),
        aggregation=[aggregations.Avg(), aggregations.Count(), aggregations.Max()],
        use_timestamps=True,
        num_features=10,
        num_subfeatures=1,
        max_length=1,
        fast_training=False,
        min_num_samples=200,
        shrinkage=0.0,
        grid_factor=1.0,
        share_aggregations=1.0
    ).send()

There is one hyperparameter we have not seen so far: *num_subfeatures*. As the name implies, it controls the number of subfeatures between two peripheral tables.

Fitting
^^^^^^^^^

Everything else should seem very familiar:

::

    model = model.fit(
        population_table=population_table,
        peripheral_tables=[peripheral_table, peripheral_table2]
    )

    scores = model.score(
        population_table=population_table,
        peripheral_tables=[peripheral_table, peripheral_table2]
    )

    features = model.transform(
        population_table=population_table,
        peripheral_tables=[peripheral_table, peripheral_table2]
    )

    yhat = model.predict(
        population_table=population_table,
        peripheral_tables=[peripheral_table, peripheral_table2]
    )


Generating SQL code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    print(model.to_sql())

Here is the SQL code AutoSQL has generated:
