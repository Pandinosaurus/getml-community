Starting the AutoSQL engine
===============================================

The AutoSQL engine is a standalone program that does the actual work of fitting your features. It makes installation of AutoSQL a lot easier. Because we have outsourced the calculation-intensive part to a standalone program written in C++, the AutoSQL Python library is written in pure Python.

Use the *cd* command to get into the folder from which you have installed AutoSQL.

On **Linux** and **macOS**:

::

    cd /path/to/your/folder
    ./run

on **Windows**:

::

    cd C:\path\to\your\folder
    run.batch

Alternatively, you can just click on *run.batch* on **Windows**.

If the console prints out a copyright notice, the licensing terms and some basic instructions for running the engine (as pictured above), everything is fine.

You can then start Python in a different console (of course, you could use Pycharm, Spyder, Jupyter or another tool of your choice).
