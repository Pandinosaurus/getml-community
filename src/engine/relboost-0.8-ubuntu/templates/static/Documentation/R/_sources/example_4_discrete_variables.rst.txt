Example 4: Discrete variables
------------------------------

For a full working example, please refer to :ref:`example_04_discrete_values.R`.

Discrete variables are numerical variables that can only assume whole numbers. A typical example might be number of units sold: The number of units sold is numerical, but it can only assume whole numbers. It makes very little sense to say that I sold 3956.283 units in the last month.

When you know that certain variables are discrete, you should probably mark them as such. This can increase accuracy and produce more readable SQL code.

Let's just say we have a problem like this, where *t2.column_01* is a discrete variable:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT MIN( t2.column_01 )
    FROM POPULATION_TABLE t1
    LEFT JOIN PERIPHERAL_TABLE t2
    ON t1.join_key = t2.join_key
    WHERE (
       ( t2.column_01 > 0 )
    ) AND t2.time_stamps <= t1.time_stamps
    GROUP BY t2.join_key;

Building the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can then mark this as a discrete variable, just like we mark categorical or numerical variables:

.. code-block:: r

    population.placeholder <- create.autosql.placeholder(
        "POPULATION",
        discrete=c( "column_01" ),
        join.keys=c( "join_key" ),
        time.stamps=c( "time_stamp" ),
        targets=c( "targets" )
    )

    peripheral.placeholder <- create.autosql.placeholder(
        "PERIPHERAL",
        discrete=c( "column_01" ),
        join.keys=c( "join_key" ),
        time.stamps=c( "time_stamp" )
    )

    population.placeholder <- join.autosql.placeholder(
        population.placeholder,
        peripheral.placeholder,
        "join_key",
        "time_stamp"
    )

    model = create.autosql.model(
        population=population.placeholder,
        peripheral=list(peripheral.placeholder),
        aggregation=list(        
           autosql.count, 
           autosql.sum,
           autosql.min
        ),
        use.timestamps=TRUE,
        num.features=10,
        max.length=2,
        fast.training=FALSE,
        min.num.samples=200,
        shrinkage=0.0,
        grid.factor=1.0,
        share.aggregations=1.0,
        num.threads=6,
        regularization=0.01,
        predictor=autosql.create.xgboost.regressor()
    )

    send.autosql.model(model)

    model = fit.autosql.model(
        model,
        population.table,
        peripheral.table
    )

The remainder is straight-forward. We use *.fit(...)*, *.transform(...)*, *.predict(...)* and *.to_sql(...)* like we always have.

Generating SQL code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The resulting SQL code looks like this:

.. code-block:: sql
