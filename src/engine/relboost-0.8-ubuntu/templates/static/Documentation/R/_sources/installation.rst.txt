Installation
===================

Step 1: Install the AutoSQL engine for your operating system. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You do **NOT** need root or admin rights to install the AutoSQL engine.

On **Linux** and **macOS**, use *cd* to get into the folder that contains *setup.sh*. Then, run setup.sh.

::

    cd /path/to/your/folder
    sh setup.sh

You should now get a message that AutoSQL was successfully installed.

On **Windows**, no installation is necessary other than unzipping the ZIP-file.

Step 2: Install the AutoSQL R API. 
--------------------------------------------------------

Use the *cd* command to get into the folder callsed *R*, which contains another folder called *autosql*, like this:

::

    cd /path/to/your/folder

on Windows:

::

    cd C:\path\to\your\folder


Then, type:

::

    R CMD INSTALL autosql

The installation should take about one second. You might need root rights for this.

Then, type "R" into your terminal and import autosql, like this:

.. code-block:: r

    library(autosql)

If that worked well, you are done. We hope you enjoy using AutoSQL.
